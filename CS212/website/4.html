            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Dear Mom,
                I have been taking an English class this semester which you know was the first class that I got a C in, so it is not my most fond subject. I always struggled grasping the bigger idea behind the assignments I was given and how every time you would ask me to talk to my sisters so that they could help me with whatever I was struggling in. I would always go to you when I struggled because you are so smart, so you were my go-to. I think we have found a solution because of English 105 has taught me a lot of ways to help better my writing ability. It has taught me to keep revising my essays or writings because the first draft might be messy, but it is the base of something great, so I need to take the base and make an empire. Throughout the entire semester we would always at least once revise our essay and then turn it back in after we also got peer feedback. Using all of this new information on how to revise old essays I am going to revise my Rhetorical Analysis. I will also transform my Collaborative Research Project on mental health issues at colleges into an infographic, which I will present to my class as a part of my final portfolio. 
            </p>
            <h2>Final Portfolio</h2>
            <p> To share more about my Final Portfolio, I want to share with you what I Included in my Rhetorical Analysis essay which I wrote at the very beginning of the semester. It was a very difficult essay to write about and I did decently well with, but I wished I could have done even better. For my analysis I had analyzed multiple ads about homeless people which all used the rhetorical tactic of pathos. Pathos is using emotion to persuade the audience to believe whatever the person who made it to believe whatever the person wants them to believe. To me I kind of twisted the essay and made it a compare of the ads. I took three ads which I then stated what rhetorical strategies the ads used and how some of the ways the ads were being used were helping or hurting the ad to get the point across. With this I not only analyzed the ads, but I also constructed </p>
            <h2>Struggles</h2>
            <p>Going through the struggles of making this essay I developed a lot of stress which is also why I was so compassionate about writing my Collaborative Research Project. That essay was about mental health issues in colleges and how they are helping students get through them. Researching with a couple of my classmates to create an amazing essay helped me see different views as well. Knowing all this information was really good but I did have to do quite a lot of researching to figure out how and what I have available to me here at NAU. For that reason, I wanted to make an infographic about mental health issues at NAU. I wanted to make most of this project statistically valuable, but I also wanted to share with students across campus what they have available for them and how to make the resources most useful for them. With the infographic I want to show the students that are dealing with these things that they are not the only ones. There are many students who feel the same way, so it is a good idea to go get help. I want it to encourage them to use the resources since they realize they are not alone.  </p>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p> Throughout the entire semester I had done a lot of things in this English class and of course have things to take away. Specifically, I have 5, one about rhetorical knowledge, one about critical thinking, another about processes, another about knowledge of conventions, and last about reflective learning. The one I felt like I took away with the most in rhetorical knowledge was c. It is applying the concepts of rhetoric in my writing which I did when I wrote the rhetorical analysis. Although I struggled with this essay the most as well which is why I am going to revise it I also learned the most about these strategies.  I learned how to look at the choices of the author in the ad and ask why they made those decisions. In critical thinking I learned to write in various contexts like a narrative or analysis or even a collaborative essay. I had to learn how to write in different contexts because I was working with two other students in order to write one essay that sounded and flowed all the same. Throughout the entire semester we had to learn how to write in different tones, perspectives, all of that in order to turn in different types of projects. In processes I learned how to give constructive feedback to my peers on their drafts in order for them to revise it. After every first draft we made we would have the opportunity to give and get feedback to and from our peers. Learning to adapt elements like organization, word choice, format, and design features to match conventions was something I also had to do in order to make my group’s collaborative essay work. We all had different ideas, ways of talking, different ways of writing an essay and we needed to mold it all together for it to work. It is also a learning outcome in knowledge of conventions. Last but not least in reflective learning I had to take what I learned from one project and incorporate it into the other project. In the very first project I learned I needed to make sure my focus was on the prompt of the project and not steer off into my own world. The first project was about the religion of Islam and the struggles they have in our country. It was hard not to write about how I thought I felt about the religion or how I thought they are treated in the USA. Constructing my focus into what happens and what the religion was really about is what I learned. So consciously synthesize and integrate insights from one project into another was the outcome I achieved in that category. Throughout this whole semester mom, I learned so much which is why I will not be crying to you for help anymore, and why I will not have to ask my sisters for much help. I will hopefully not be ending this class with another C. I have finally developed the skills in order to do what needs to be done in English classes so I can finish strongly or stronger than a C and more confident where I won’t cry or go to my sisters. Love you and see you soon.</p>
            <h2>Addendum</h2>
            <p>Throughout this lab I was trying different articles to put in the lab and for awhile some just didn't fit very well but then I finally found one. </p>
            <p>In my head I just pictured how I wanted it to show up on the website and from that I picked the article and then sketched it on paper of how I should code it in here. I then worked on it in VS Code to actually see how my website would look with all the things I have had planned and then from then on would fix the bugs and make it look how I pictured it.</p>
